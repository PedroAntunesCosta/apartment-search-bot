# Apartment search bot

Google app script I created to get the most recent apartments listed for sale in dfimoveis.com.br, a real estate website from BrasÃ­lia.

To implement it, follow these steps:
1. Create a new spreadsheet in google drive.
2. Go to `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.
3. This will open a new app script project in a new tab. Create the files there and copy my code.
